## Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
### Emory University 2013-2016

Here you can find all the projects and assignments that I worked on during my undergraduate at Emory University. I also took two graduate level courses.

### Some code that I'd like to highlight:
CS171:
- [Facespace - simple facebook BST] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Intro%20to%20CS171/Facebook%20project)
- [GuessingGame] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Intro%20to%20CS171/Guessing_Game%20-hw1)

CS323:
- [AutoComplete] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20%26%20Algorithms%20-%20CS323/hw2)
- [MST] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20%26%20Algorithms%20-%20CS323/hw3)
- [IntroSort] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20%26%20Algorithms%20-%20CS323/hw1)

CS540: 
- [ClassScheduler (software engineering project with a team - MEAN stack)] (https://github.com/tameravci/Class-Scheduler---Apollo)

CS551:
- [All the projects -UNIX] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Systems%20Programming%20UNIX%20-%20CS551)

### Notes:
- Most of the code here (those with a statement at the top) is my own and using it without giving credit would be an honor code violation.
- Some code lacks documentation.
- Feel free to point out my mistakes and suggest improvements.
- Around 90% of these assignments received perfect grades.
